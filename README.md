## Introduction

The **Do What The Fuck You Want Public License Plus** (WTFPL+) is an evolution of the famously short and permissive WTFPL.  The original WTFPL essentially boiled down to: *"Do whatever the hell you want."* However, in some countries there have been cases where software authors were sued despite such permissive terms,  often because their software allegedly caused **damage** or **did not function as expected**.

To address these situations, **Version 1.0.0** adds a clear and detailed **disclaimer**.  This disclaimer explicitly states that the software is provided **without any warranty whatsoever**,  and that the authors accept **no liability** for damages, data loss, or any other consequences.
