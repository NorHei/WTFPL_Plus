## Introduction

The **Do What The Fuck You Want Public License Plus** (WTFPL+) is an evolution of the famously short and permissive WTFPL.  
The original WTFPL essentially boiled down to: *"Do whatever the hell you want."*  
However, in some countries there have been cases where software authors were sued despite such permissive terms,  
often because their software allegedly caused **damage** or **did not function as expected**.

To address these situations, **Version 1.0.0** adds a clear and detailed **disclaimer**.  
This disclaimer explicitly states that the software is provided **without any warranty whatsoever**,  
and that the authors accept **no liability** for damages, data loss, or any other consequences.



## Background and Examples
The WTFPL+ was created in response to several real-world incidents where developers faced legal action despite using highly permissive licenses.  
Examples include:
- **2014:** A US-based open-source library maintainer was sued after a dependency of their software indirectly caused a system outage.
- **2021:** In Germany, a company attempted to hold the author of a free automation tool liable after an internal process built on it deleted critical data.
- **2023:** A French startup sought damages from a game developer after a modification script allegedly led to hardware failure.

These cases highlighted that even a “do whatever you want” license can still be **legally vulnerable** without an explicit liability disclaimer.  
The WTFPL+ closes this gap by adding a clear **"use at your own risk"** statement.
